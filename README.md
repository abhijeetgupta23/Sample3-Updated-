# Sample3-Updated-
This is a basic app I'm making which inputs Name and Department. Once inputs are taken, the name is added to the respective department and displayed accordingly. However, its not the finished product. Features such as Inputing the login details and transfering it to a fragment is not working. Refer to Sample3/main/java/com/example/android/sample3/AppDevelopmentFragment.java for the the latest code which is in the process of being debugged.

Thanks !!!!
